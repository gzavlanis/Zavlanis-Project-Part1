# Final Project
## Part 1: Breaf introduction to the dataset and first analytics
### Georgios Zavlanis 05-01-2025

In this first part of the final project, I dedicated my time to the study and analysis of the data. By making the appropriate transformations, I created separate data sets, in order to carry out the analyses listed in the code files so far.

Conclusions of the procedures are shown in the form of diagrams in the Plots folder and in printouts in the terminal.

In order to run the project run in terminal:

```aiexclude
pip install requirements.txt
```
